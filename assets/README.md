# Assets

Repository-level assets used for frontend design and branding work.

## Structure
- `assets/logos/`
  - Brand logos and product marks used in UI implementations.
- `assets/design-inspirations/`
  - Reference screenshots or design inspiration images for UI recreation/exploration.

## Usage Notes
- Prefer real assets from this folder over placeholders when available.
- Keep copyright-sensitive or licensed assets only if you have permission to store them in the repository.
- Add a short source note filename or adjacent text when storing inspiration images (for traceability).
